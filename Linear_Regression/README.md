# Linear Regression:

One of the use case, we tried to cover was to recommend movie from a business owner’s perspective. Along with the user’s historical movie ratings the more the revenue earned from a movie, the business owner can recommend that movie. 
To check if there is any correlation between ‘ratings’ and ‘imdb_score’ we performed a linear regression. As the results were not good, we inferred that there is no linear relationship between revenue and imdb_score.
